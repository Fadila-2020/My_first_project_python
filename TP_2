### In this exercise, we will explore and create a heatmap. We will use the flights dataset
# from the seaborn library to generate a heatmap depicting the number of passengers
# per month across the years 1949-1960:
flights_df = sns.load_dataset('flights')

#Now we need to pivot the dataset on the required variables using the pivot() function before
#generating the heatmap. The pivot function first takes as arguments the feature that will be displayed in rows,
#then the one displayed in columns, and finally the feature whose variation we are interested in observing. 
#It uses unique values from specified indexes/columns to form axes of the resulting DataFrame:


df_pivoted = flights_df.pivot("month", "year", "passengers")
ax = sns.heatmap(df_pivoted)
